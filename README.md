# FLASK
  
  this is the required solution of the DevOps testing

# Use the Scientific Python Devevelopment Environment ( SPYDER 3)
  
  this is available with Anaconda navigator
  used for interactive testing & debugging

# create project directory.
 
 -- Testing Flask
    
    is the poject name
 
 -- set as working project directory
    
    this is where the program will run
    
# set project directory as the working directory 
-- app.py 
   
   is the python program to be tested and run
   
 ** set iPython console in the project environment

# update into project directory
-- user.json
   
   is the user data that is assigned to the various variables within the program

# install dependencies in iPython console
-- pip install -U Flask
  
  // restart kernel 

-- pip install -U flask-cors
  
  // restart kernel

-- pip install Flask-RESTful
  
  // restart kernel

*** all commits installed and updated into project console.

# Run the project file 
-- run app.py

# Debug
-- debug app.py

# Perform arithmetic operations 
-- ops = '-' , '+', '*', '/'

# Debugging
-- x = value of input(x)
-- y = calue of input(y)
